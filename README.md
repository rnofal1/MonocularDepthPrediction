# A Deep Learning Approach to Single-Image Depth Prediction

## Results

## Overview
Depth information is essential to numerous computer vision tasks, from autonomous driving to augmented reality. Traditional methods of depth estimation, such as
LIDAR and RGBD cameras, can be expensive, large, and susceptible to adverse weather conditions. This project implements a deep-learning assisted, monocular approach to depth prediction,
which promises to alleviate some of the drawbacks of traditional methods.  

The network implemented in this project was first proposed by Eigen et al.
